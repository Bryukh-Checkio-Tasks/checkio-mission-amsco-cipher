    Let's look at AMSCO cipher. This is positional cipher with exchanges.
    You can easily encode or decode a message with a pen and paper, of course if you know the key.
</p>

<p>
    The key is represented as a number that consist by unique digits from 1 to N.
    N is a length of the key.
    To encode message we should write a message in a matrix with N columns.
    The matrix is writen row by row.
    In this process, alternately one or two characters are recorded in a field.
    one or two characters alternate in rows and in columns too (as chessboard).
    The first element is single letter field (this is the arrangement for this mission).
    The last field can have a single characters if they are not enough.
    Then columns are numbered by digits from the key as they are ordered.
    For example, for key 312 the first column will be 3, the second - 1 and the third - 2.
    And the last you write all characters by columns as they were numbered in the recent step.

    All whitespaces and punctuations symbols are excluded and letters are lowercase.

<p>
    Let's look at this with an example. The message "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet". And the key is 4123.
    The cut message is "loremipsumdolorsitamet". In matrix form it will be:

</p>
<pre class="brush: plain">
   4   1   2   3
   l  or   e  mi
  ps   u  md   o
   l  or   s  it
  am   e   t
</pre>
<p>
    Now write colums as they are numbered in the ascending order - "oruore", "emdst", "mioit", "lpslam".
    And the encoded message is "oruoreemdstmioitlpslam".
</p>
<p>
    You are given an encoded message and the key. Your mission is to decode the message.
    Of course in the cut version.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Two arguments. A message as a string (unicode) and a key as an integer.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The decoded message as a string.
